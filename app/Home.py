We aim to tackle issues such as inefficient waste treatment, limited recycling rates, and environmental impact caused by improper waste disposal. By harnessing the potential of data science, we can identify opportunities for improvement, optimize waste treatment methods, and ultimately enhance the sustainability of our local waste management system.""")
